Our First schools game project (12.2020-3.2021)

In this project we had 2 programmers and 3 graphic artists.

My part was to be project lead, game designer and writing code. 
Roughly 85% of games code is made by me.
I also composed and played games music's and recorded sound effects.
Cos this was first real game project for me it really teach me a lot what it takes to make a game.
At this point of my road to be part of game industry community, you do learn new things every day and get better and better. At least if you have some sort of passion for it.
How to collabrate with others, setting deadlines and keeping those and mostly what not to do in next projects.
After this project i think i understand how important gameDesignDocument and other plans are to make well. With sloppy planing and designing you really can mess 
your project or at least make it really hard to go through.
I think if you look scripts in this repository you can see that our level of planing ahead was not in highest level.

But

We finnished our game on time and it can be found from itch.io -> under username tunixxx78.
